Overview

This is a library management system built using C# to help develop my understand of C#. The goal was to build a library system using an external API to search for books, check them out, and return them.

I used object oriented programing such as encapsulation and abstraction. I also included an external API with Open Library

I wrote this as practice in breaking down a developer problem into parts and stretching what I already knew to include work with json and API. I have also never had to set up my own .csproj, or .sln.

# Future Work

Improvements

- create a more user friendly GUI
- Create or download a fictional library of books so I can control borrowing and returning.
- Add an SQL data system to store borrowing information 
- create a list for library patrons to join the library
